### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zafer.
I live in Istanbul/Turkey. I blog as a hobby and I am interested in web programming. I started programming with pascal during high school education in 2004. In the following years I was interested in Visual Basic, Delphi, Asp. During my university years, I studied C and PHP. As the years of education ended, I continued with web programming, which I liked more. 

I like to try different programming languages and design tools. But I can't really learn any of them. I produce content and themes related to Blogger/Blogspot.
